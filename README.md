An open streetlight controller that dims LED streetlights by schedule and presence, reports faults and hosts other city sensors on the lamp pole.

## Concept rationale

An open controller saves energy and turns every pole into a place to host sensors.

## Burning platform

Street lighting is often one of a city's largest electricity costs.

## Where it could be used

### By industry

| Industry | Use |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

### By country or region

| Country or region | Why it matters there |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

## What sparked the idea

It came out of a September 2026 review of Design Molecule's applied research areas against the open projects already in the lab.

## Problem

Streetlights burn at full power all night, faults are reported by residents, and proprietary controllers lock cities into one vendor.

## Concept

An open streetlight controller that dims LED streetlights by schedule and presence, reports faults and hosts other city sensors on the lamp pole.

## Key components

- Standard lamp pole connector module
- Dimming driver interface
- Presence sensor
- Energy metering
- Radio and controller
- Sensor expansion port

The working bill of materials is in [bom/bom.csv](bom/bom.csv).

## Safety

> Mains wiring must be done or checked by a qualified electrician and follow local electrical code. Street furniture and pole mounts must be installed only with the asset owner's permission, by trained crews, with fall protection and traffic management as local rules require.

## Documentation

Controlled documents follow the portfolio [documentation standard](.kit/STANDARDS.md). Each carries a document ID (LPN-PRC-001 for the precis), a version and a revision history. Branded PDFs are built with `python .kit/render.py` and attached to GitHub Releases when a document is tagged, for example `LPN-PRC-001/v1.0`.
